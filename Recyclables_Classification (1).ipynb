        "# My First Machine Learning Project: Recyclables Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "I thought long and hard about my first personal project because I want it to be meaningful and purposeful and also aid in my machine learning learning journey and into computer vision. Everywhere I search there is already a project or a blog written about solving a certain problem, such as identifying and classfying local cuisines, or generating music. After researching hard and long, I have decided to just start and work on recyclables classification despite there having some work done on it as well. It is simple enough for a beginner like myself and it is quite meaningful for the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be looking at the dataset provided by [garythung](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet). Since this is my first personal solo project, I do not want to be too ambitious and just want to learn the ropes and process of creating a model. Based on this [news article](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/what-can-be-recycled-plastic-paper-glass-metal-recycling-bin-box-tips-nea-3100521),  main recyclables in Singapore are glass, metal, paper and plastic, hence we shall aim to classify these 4 recyclables."

I guessed it was a computational issue so I decided to rent cloud GPUs but I met many issues with that (such as syncing images to the instance, running the code on the instance) and it wasn't reliable. In the end, I opted for Google Colab pro which would save me all the hassle. I thought the code would be done fast but it has been 19h 30min thus far and so it made me realise that perhaps I would need to downsize the images quite a bit. From this [article](https://hasty.ai/docs/mp-wiki/training-parameters/batch-size#:~:text=%22For%20the%20most%20part%2C%20a,best%20to%20begin%20experimenting%20with.%22) and this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/boost-your-image-classifier-e1cc7a56b59c), it suggests batch resizing and training the model on increasing dimensional size. For simplicity, I shall start with 32x32, then 64x64, 128x128, etc.*\n",

However, it has been a big failure of .feather files always generating samples from 1 directory or generating 20k samples in 1 .feather file. I decided to just cut out that multiprocessing step for simplicity, since data preprocessing is not the main point of this project.*\n",

        "Next, we shall add a dropout layer after the first dense layer, whcih randomly deactivates the neurons of this dense layer to prevent overfitting by preventing reliance on any particular set of neurons. We will set 0.5 as the fraction of neurons to drop for starters\n",
        "\n",
        "For the third tweak, we would be adding early stopping to monitor models' validation accuracy and stopping the model when it no longer shows improvement, to find the optimal epoch number and prevent overfitting. We shall start with a small patience value at 10 for now.\n",
